# Project: Image Caption and Generation

Duration: 5 weeks
## Week 1
- Focused on the fundamentals of data preprocessing
- Familiarized ourselves with various machine learning models through a classification problem
- Task was to predict the failure of a product using its attributes and measurements
- Applied the concepts learned through hands-on experimentation with real-world data
- Explored different classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, and compared their performance
- Discussed the importance of feature engineering and data cleaning in this task
## Week 2
- Emphasis of the second week was on training a neural network to identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset
- Delved into the essential concepts of backpropagation, activation functions, data preprocessing, and the process of tuning the hyperparameters
- Achieved a high level of accuracy, with the model correctly identifying digits with 98% accuracy
- This experience provided a strong foundation for understanding the inner workings of neural networks and how to optimize their performance
- Discussed the different types of neural networks and their applications
## Week 3
- Delved deeper into convolutional neural networks and applied them to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Hands-on experience implementing Convnets
- Explored various techniques to optimize the performance of Convnets
- This week provided a deeper understanding of how Convnets work and how they can be used for image classification tasks
- Discussed the different architectures of Convnets and their applications
## Week 4
- Presented with two challenges that required the application of advanced machine learning techniques:
- Forecasting oil prices for the next 30 days using historical data
- Performing sentiment analysis on stock market statements or headlines
- Studied Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models
- Trained an LSTM model to predict oil prices
- Applied basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as stopword removal, tokenization, and lemmatization to predict sentiments
- This week provided an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with advanced machine-learning techniques and apply them to real-world problems
- Discussed the different types of RNNs and their applications
## Week 5
- The final week of the program brought all the concepts and techniques learned throughout the course together, as we were given the task of generating captions for images in the Flickr8k dataset
- Employed a pre-trained neural network, VGG 19, for extracting features from the images
- These features were then fed into an LSTM model for caption generation
- Integrated the VGG19 with LSTMs by fine tuning the already trained VGG19 model
- Used NLP on the descriptions of the images using the NLTK libraries.
- The LSTM and VGG19 were taken from the keras library.
- Used BLEU score as the evaluation metric for the model. Obtained the BLEU-1,2,3,4 scores
- Discussed the importance of evaluation metrics in this task
- Provided an opportunity to integrate and apply the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to solve real-world problems.

- Integrated and applied knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to solve real-world problems.
